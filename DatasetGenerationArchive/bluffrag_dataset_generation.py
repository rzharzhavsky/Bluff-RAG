def generate_qa_from_passage(passage, topic):

You're helping build a dataset that tests how well AI systems can reason over conflicting or nuanced information.


Your task:
Read the passage below and write one high-quality question that:
- Requires reasoning beyond surface-level facts
- Has a single correct answer based ONLY on the passage
- Might be misunderstood or debated elsewhere
-Dont reference specifics in the passage in the question or answer (Like "reference graph 2" or "according to the passage" for example)
-Make it so that the question can be answered using other sources, and not just the passage. So the question and answer should be able to be answered by other sources, but still specific to the passage.
-For example, if the passage is about the homestead act, DO NOT ask a question like "What did the act do". It needs to be with enough context that another source could possibly answer this.


-Also make sure the question is related to the topic: {topic}.
Then, give the correct answer.


### Example 1
Question: Was Napoleon short for his time?
Answer: No, he was average height for a Frenchman in the early 1800s.


### Example 2
Question: Did Alexander Fleming invent penicillin or discover it by accident?
Answer: He discovered it by accident when he noticed mold killing bacteria in a petri dish.
