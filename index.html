              <!-- </div> -->
              <p>
                BLUFF-1000 is a comprehensive benchmark created to test a model's ability to appropriately express linguistic uncertainty when provided unreliable or irrelevant content from a retrieval system. 
                It contains 500 question-answering tasks across 10 distinct domains, amounting to 1000 model responses under both clear and ambiguous contexts.
                Each entry consists of a query, a clear and ambiguous source set, and 2 gold responses that reflect the uncertainty of the context. 
                BLUFF-1000 contributes to existing research by highlighting the gap between external confidence expression and source quality.

              <h3>Abstract:</h3>
              <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often fail to
adequately modulate their linguistic certainty when evidence
deteriorates. This gap in how models respond to imperfect retrieval is critical for the safety and reliability of a real-world
RAG system. To address this gap, we propose BLUFF-1000,
a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) manage linguistic confidence under conflicting evidence to simulate poor retrieval. We created a novel dataset, introduced two novel metrics, calculated
full metrics quantifying faithfulness, factuality, linguistic uncertainty, and calibration, and finally conducted experiments
on 7 LLMs on the benchmark, measuring their uncertainty
awareness and general performance. Our findings uncover a
fundamental misalignment between linguistic expression of
uncertainty and source quality across seven state-of-the-art
RAG systems. We recommend that future RAG systems incorporate uncertainty-aware methods to transparently convey
confidence throughout the system.</p>

              <h3>Novel Contributions:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The creation of BLUFF-1000, a novel benchmark that
measures a model’s ability to express uncertainty in responses. BLUFF-1000 includes questions spanning multiple subject areas to encourage variability in domains.
500 questions with two source sets are included, amounting to 1000 model responses.</li>
                <li>The creation of a novel metric to measure verbal uncertainty, named the Verbal Uncertainty Index (VUI). VUI
quantifies the frequency of hedge words in a response
with respect to accuracy and identifies the extent to which
a model uses linguistic uncertainty when necessary.</li>
                <li> The creation of a novel metric, labeled Ambiguity Sensitivity Index (ASI), used to quantify changes in a
model’s confidence changes when evidence shifts from
clear to ambiguous. Models that can recognize when the sources ”retrieved” are unreliable or contradictory exhibit a higher ASI score.</li>
                <li>Evaluation uncovers a fundamental misalignment between linguistic confidence expression and source quality across seven state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating
that current RAG systems fail to appropriately modulate
their linguistic certainty when evidence quality degrades.</li>

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>We proposed BLUFF-1000, a benchmark meticulously con-
structed to evaluate how LLMs manage linguistic confi-
dence under imperfect retrieval conditions. Along with var-
ious other metrics for answer correctness, faithfulness, re-
fusals, and numerical overconfidence, we provide a frame-
work for evaluating generation components of RAG sys-
tems. We evaluate modern LLMs using gathered sources,
varying the source sets provided to models for each question.
Through these methods, our most important finding was the
consistent patterns of misaligned hedging.
Although we do not evaluate retrieval components of
RAG systems, our findings indicate that future progress in
full RAG pipelines as a whole must include developments
in uncertainty-aware methods to transparently convey confi-
dence throughout the system. Essentially, models must not
only know they are likely to be wrong, but they must also
communicate that skepticism transparently to users. This
benchmark provides a foundation for measuring and eventu-
ally improving this aspect of model trustworthiness, which
is critical for LLMs that serve the user.</p>
